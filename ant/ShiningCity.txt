1. Under a Hill

When I was young, I loved exploring the passages and walkways the servants used to move, scurrying unseen through our old house. I rarely met any others on my quests, but those I did all seemed awfully dull, focused on their tasks and unable to dream, unwilling to try.

It was always assumed that I would serve the queen. What else was there for me? The queen had many suitors, 

I flew to one of the faraway lands where The great slow lumbering beasts that tower above us live, their tops scraping the sky and their bottoms crushing everything, with no perceptible sense in their actions.

I feel a rumbling. I stay very still. There is a shadow. It grows.

I am afraid.

2. Upon a Hill

When I was young, I used to love exploring the passages and walkways the servants used to use to move, scurrying, unseen through our old house. I didn't met many other children, but those I did often seemed awfully dull, and I couldn't understand why they looked at me like some kind of strange beast when I asked them about theirs. It's not as if we had servants -who does?- but the memorial vestiges of that time still remain forever imprinted, saved, within the architecture of the building.


He would join the army
Serve the queen
Democracy came
Chaos



It was always assumed that I would join the army and serve the queen, but when democracy came, it brought chaos. The queen was no more, but the war raged on. I flew to a faraway land full of strange people and lobbed mortars at them. They, in turn, lobbed mortars back. To comfort myself I would disappear into my mind, to fond memories of my childhood, before the war. To the long passageways in the old house, where I could hide from the world and spy on the others going about their way. To the fields outside. I ran in the meadow, my footfalls heavy in the grass. I saw a great fire ant-hill ahead, and stopped suddenly before coming any nearer and risking tripping over it. But then I crept closer, my curiosity overwhelming my desire to avoid danger . The hill was teeming with the little creatures, running over and through each other in their hurry. I fathomed no rhyme or reason to their movement, chaotic and disorganized as it seemed.

I'm shaken out of my thoughts by a rushing sound. I hold very still. There is a shadow.

In this moment, I am afraid.

Chaos



It was always assumed that I would serve the queen, but when she fell, it brought chaos. The queen was no more, and a war raged in her stead-- both at home, and in the rest of the kingdom. In her service, or not, I flew to a faraway land full of strange people and lobbed mortars at them. They, in turn, lobbed mortars back. To comfort myself I would disappear into my mind, to fond memories of my childhood, before the war.
