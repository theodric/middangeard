This ant is my travelling companion today.

The ant crawled onto my train in search of something to eat. The train is full of good things for an ant to eat, and so the ant stayed, and it ate. But there is one thing the ant had not counted on: trains can move. They can move very fast and go very far, much too far for an ant to travel on its own, even in its whole life. And so the ant is trapped, although it doesn't realize this yet. It will die on this train. It is inevitable. 

The ant has plenty on the train - more than enough to last its entire life - but it is alone. If the ant could think, it would think about its home colony. It would think about all of its sisters, and the hustle and bustle of life back home, and how it can never return. This would make the ant sad.

Perhaps the ant will leave the train when it stops. Perhaps it will find another colony that seems like its own. But the ants in that colony will never accept this ant, because it is not one of them. This ant will always be alone. It is inevitable.

If the ant could think thoughts, they would be sad thoughts. It is lucky that it cannot think.

I think I am like this ant.
